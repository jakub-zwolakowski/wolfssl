# WHAT HAPPENS?

Without the cast to `unsigned char` the result of `-bnegative` is promoted to
`int`. In that case the left operand of `<<` has value `-8` and behavior is
undefined.

When we add the cast, the left operand of `<<` has value `248` and everything
goes well: `babs` gets value `8` in the end.
